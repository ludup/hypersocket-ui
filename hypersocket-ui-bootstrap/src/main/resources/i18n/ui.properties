realms.info=Realms are separate databases of resources and configuration that are independent of each other. Each Realm connects to a distinct user database so \
typically you would only have one Realm if you are installing this server for use within your own business. However by creating multiple Realms the Administrator \
can provide these services to multiple tenants with different requirements with each optionally having its own host name to access the service.
